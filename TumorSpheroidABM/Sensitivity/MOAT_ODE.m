% This algorithm is an adaptation of the method of Sensitivity Analysis
% called the Morris method.
%
% Sensitivity analysis is used to estimate the influence of uncertainty
% factors on the output of a function.
% The Morris method is sometimes referenced to as a qualitative method : it
% gives rough estimations with a limited number of calculations.
% The Morris method can be used to simplify a function, as a first step. It
% can identify the factors with a low influence which can be fixed.

% This algorithm reduces the risk to underestimate and fix non-negligible
% factors. It is presented in:

% This program is divided in 6 parts:
% 1) Clearing the memory
% 2) Parameters : Please fill in
% 3) Initialization of the variables
% 4) Loop
% 5) Output text
% 6) Figure
%
% Please fill in the second part to apply the algorithm to your function.
% Do not change the parameters to see the results with the "modified Sobol
% test function".
%
% This program outputs a figure as well as a short summary in the console.
% Consider fixing the factors which appear as negligible on the left of the
% figure (not necessary all the factors under the limit).
%% 1) Clearing the memory
clearvars; % Clears the memory

%% 2) Parameters : Please fill in
% Maximum number of simulation runs :
% Large number = better estimation of the influence of the factors
% Recommended value : (number of factors + 1) * 10
% The algorithm will maybe exceed this value if it is considered necessary
options.limit_factor = 0.5; % how to set the limit for separating low and high impact factors
options.initialization_factor = 0.8; % how to determine when it has been sufficiently initialized
nsim_max = 210;
% Function studied :
% Replace test_function by the name of your function. It must be a 
% function with one multidimensional input x. x must represent the values 
% of the uncertainty factors in the quantiles hyperspace (the i-th 
% coordinate of x is not the actual value of the i-th factor, but the 
% corresponding value of the cumulative distribution function of the i-th 
% factor). To adapt your function, first calculate the actual values of 
% the factors by applying the inverse of their cumulative distribution 
% function to each coordinate of x; Matlab includes such inverses: 
% mathworks.com/help/stats/icdf.html ).

par_names = ["lambda";"alpha";"K"];
D = makeMOATDistributions_ODE(par_names);

% Number of factors of uncertainty of the function studied :
nfac=numel(par_names); 

assert(nfac==numel(par_names)) % make sure that there is a value for each of the parameters to be varied
assert(D.numEntries==numel(par_names)) % make sure each parameter has an associated distribution
studied_function = @(x) moatSample_ODE(x,par_names,D);

%% 3) Initialization of the variables
table_outputs = []; % All the outputs of the simulations runs. One line = results around one point of the factors hyperspace. First column = output at a sampled point, second column = output after varying the first factor, etc...
table_ee = []; % All the elementary effects. One line = elementary effects at one point of the factors hyperspace. First column = elementary effect of the first factor, etc... See the relation between the outputs of the simulation run and the elementary effects.
factors_over = []; % Indexes of the factors over the limit (important factors). The elementary effects of these factors will not be calculated at the next step.
table_factors_over = []; % Factors over the limit at the different steps. n-th line = factors with no elementary effect at the n-th step = factors over the limit at the (n-1)-th step.
points=[]; % Sampled points of the factors hyperspace where the elementary effects are calculated.
n=1; % Current step.
nsim = nfac+1; % Number of simulation runs after the next step.
initialization = 0; % Boolean, the calculations will foccus on the factors under the limit when it will equal 1.
convergence = 0; % Boolean, equals 1 when the factors over the limit have not changed over the last steps.
%% 4) Loop
while (nsim <= nsim_max) || (n<=size(table_ee,1)) || ~convergence 
% Continues if at least one of the conditions is true
% Condition 1 : The calculations can continue if the number of simulation runs after the next step (nsim) is not larger than the maximum number of simulation runs
% Condition 2 : The calculations can continue if the algorithm returned to a previous step and did not finish to complete the table of elementary effects
% Condition 3 : The calculations can continue if the set of factors over the limit has changed over the last steps
    % Application of the algorithm at the current step:
    [ table_outputs, table_ee, factors_over, n, points, initialization ] = moat_loop_function( nfac, studied_function, table_outputs, table_ee, factors_over, n, points, initialization );

    table_factors_over(n,1:length(factors_over)) = factors_over;
    
    % Comparison of the factors over the limit over the three last steps
    if n>=4 % After one application of moat_loop_function, n=2. Thus, three steps are completed when n>=4.
        
        % Last step
        factors_n = table_factors_over(n,:); % n-th line of table_factors_over
        to_delete = factors_n==0; % Depending on the number of factors over the limit at the other steps, there may be zeros in factors_n
        factors_n(to_delete) = []; % The zeros are deleted (they are not factors indexes).
        factors_n = sort(factors_n); % The factors are sorted in ascending order (to compare the sets of factors regardless of their values/orders)
        % Last step - 1

        factors_n_1(to_delete) = [];

        % Last step - 2
        factors_n_2 = table_factors_over(n-2,:);
        to_delete = factors_n_2==0;
        factors_n_2(to_delete) = [];
        factors_n_2 = sort(factors_n_2);
