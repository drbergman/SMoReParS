Profiles_SMFromABM_old.mat:
    This used old workflow and appears to have sometimes resulted in poor profiles.
    See out{3,1} for a profile of the carrying capacity that somehow was between 0 and 2.
    Edit: I seem to have been mistaken about out{3,1}.
        I no longer know if there are poor profiles here, but I will nonetheless continue with the profile from the new workflow.
    Not cleaned.

Profiles_SMFromABM.mat:
    The profile of the SM from the ABM for the new workflow.
    Not cleaned.

Profiles_SMFromABM_clean.mat:
    The profile of the SM from the ABM for the new workflow.
    Cleaned.
    This is exactly Profiles_SMFromABM.mat but cleaned.
    Keeping the original (Profiles_SMFromABM.mat) just in case.
